## Installation

This project is designed for Windows PowerShell 5.1 or newer.

1. Open PowerShell and inspect your profile path:

   ```powershell
   $PROFILE
   ```

2. Create or open the profile file:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

3. Copy the contents of `shell_toolbox.ps1` into the profile, save it, and reload the profile:

   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

4. Type `hilfe` to confirm that the functions are available.

If script execution is blocked, use the least permissive user-level policy needed for local scripts:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

## Technology

- Windows PowerShell 5.1+
- PowerShell profile functions and standard Windows commands
- CIM/WMI for battery information
- Windows Registry and Startup folder inspection
- `Invoke-RestMethod` for Wikipedia and Open-Meteo requests
- Windows Clipboard, Calculator, browser, Office, and shutdown integrations

## Privacy and Safety

Most commands run locally, but `r`, `s`, and `t` contact external services. Wikipedia and Open-Meteo may receive query, location, IP, or request metadata according to their own policies. Review the script before installing it into a profile.

The following commands can change or delete data or affect the system:

- `f` permanently empties the Recycle Bin.
- `j` can delete old or all files in Downloads.
- `v` deletes selected images or screenshots.
- `q` schedules a system restart.
- `m` places a generated password in the clipboard.

Use these commands only after checking the prompt and target paths. The toolbox is not a backup, password manager, or security hardening tool.

## GitHub Distribution
